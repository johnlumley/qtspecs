   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;1491 Empty record types&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As well as allowing &lt;code&gt;record()&lt;/code&gt; for an empty record type as proposed in #1491, this PR also allows named record declarations in XQuery to have no fields. In the course of implementing this I discovered there was old text in the F&amp;amp;O "Constructors" section which duplicated but had become out of sync with the XQuery spec, so much of this has been deleted and replaced with a cross-reference. Named record definitions for XSLT have not yet been defined, this is unfinished business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fix #1491&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
