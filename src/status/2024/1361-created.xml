   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;1337 Atomic value becomes atomic item&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fix #1337&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was half-expecting this change to have repercussions, but in practice it seems very clean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are probably more places that should change, e.g. use "xs:boolean item" rather than "xs:boolean value", but we can deal with them as we come to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
