   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drop unordered mode&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is there any evidence that unordered mode is useful, or that any implementations actually take note of it (by delivering a different result if unordered mode is set)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If not, could we drop it? I would suggest continuing to recognize the syntax, marking it deprecated, and saying it has no effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not doing a great deal of harm, but there are a lot of places where our examples in the spec assume ordered mode, but the examples don't explicitly call out this assumption. Similarly, a great many QT3 test cases would fail on an implementation that sets unordered mode by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
