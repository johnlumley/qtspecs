   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drop named item types other than named record types&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We started with named item types, they were mainly intended for defining records, but allowed any type. Then we realised that records required extra capability, especially recursive definitions and constructors, so we introduced &lt;code&gt;declare record&lt;/code&gt; for that case. This begs the question as to whether the general &lt;code&gt;declare type&lt;/code&gt; is still useful enough to merit inclusion. I suspect that if we had &lt;code&gt;declare record&lt;/code&gt; and didn't have &lt;code&gt;declare type&lt;/code&gt;, no one would be clamouring for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not as if all our work on this feature is done. There's still a fair bit to do on the XSLT side, as well as issues like #1520, and I don't think we've really sorted all the issues relating visibility of types to visibility of variables and functions using those types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
