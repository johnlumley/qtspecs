   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Change obsolete notes on rounding&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of non-normative notes on rounding that don't reflect the latest changes to the spec.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the specification has been left inconsistent as to whether the option for rounding to even is written as "to-even" or "half-to-even". The latter spelling was intended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
