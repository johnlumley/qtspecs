   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;compare() with collations that do not support ordering&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many functions that rely on equality-comparison of strings, for example deep-equal() and the &lt;code&gt;eq&lt;/code&gt; operator, invoke &lt;code&gt;compare(A, B, Collation)&lt;/code&gt;. But we say that some collations only support equality comparison, not ordering. Presumably (we don't actually say), &lt;code&gt;compare(A, B, Collation)&lt;/code&gt; will fail if the collation does not support ordering; but if it fails, then equality comparisons will fail as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not obvious what we should do about this. The simplest fix is probably to say that all collations must support ordering as well as equality comparison. Or we could have a fourth result value from &lt;code&gt;compare()&lt;/code&gt; to say "values not equal, but their ordering is not defined"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
