   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add more explanation on enumeration types&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 3.2.6 Enumeration Types we already have some explanation of how enumeration types work, and I think it's sound, but I think a few more words about the consequences might be useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We note correctly that &lt;code&gt;'red' instance of enum('red', 'green', 'blue')&lt;/code&gt; is false.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should also note that &lt;code&gt;let $red as enum('red', 'green', 'blue', 'yellow') := "red" return $red instance of enum('red', 'green', 'blue')&lt;/code&gt; is true; and indeed that a string S that is cast or coerced to any enumeration type that permits S is an instance of every enumeration type that permits S. This is a conscious design decision that has both advantages and disadvantages, so we should explain the consequences carefully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
