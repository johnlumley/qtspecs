   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specification Documents: Editors and Contributors&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have noticed that the headers of the specification documents of previous versions of the languages contain more than one editor. In some EXPath documents, both editors and contributors are listed (with editors doing the majority of the work).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As various people have now been contributing to the new specifications and the documents for the last months and years already, would it make sense (and would it conform to current W3 conventions) to name more than one person in the header? In either case, it should certainly be made clear that Michael Kay has contributed the very vast majority of the content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
