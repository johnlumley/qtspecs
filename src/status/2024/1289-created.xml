   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delete XQuery Appendix J&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Appendix J contains examples of XQuery applications. It already acknowledges that some of these could significantly benefit from using new features in versions 3.0 and 3.1. I think it has now served its purpose and it's time to remove it.&lt;/p&gt;
