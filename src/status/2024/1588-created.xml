   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Move the Streamability chapter?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a minor thing, but it annoys me every single time. Open up the XSLT spec and search for any instruction and the first hit in the ToC is always 19.8.4.x "Streamability of [instruction]" which has never been the reason I was looking for the instruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seems we could move 19 to 27, putting it before Serialization or we could tinker with the markup so that 19.8.4.x didn't appear in the ToC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
