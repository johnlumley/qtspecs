   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;31 Introduce "for key $k value $v in $map"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Implements ForClause / ForExpression iterating over entries in maps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that the feature is described differently in XP and XQ - I have made some starter attempts to reconverge the two specs, but there is more to be done. (However, the change involved reordering sections, which will adversely affect the diff version).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
