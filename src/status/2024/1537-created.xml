   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;XSLT: local functions within an enclosing xsl:mode&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recently wrote a multi-phase transformation and tried out the new "enclosing modes" feature where the template rules for a mode are enclosed within the &lt;code&gt;xsl:mode&lt;/code&gt; element. Worked very well, and really helps to give the stylesheet a more modular structure. But I found myself wanting to write "helper" functions within the &lt;code&gt;xsl:mode&lt;/code&gt; definition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't think it would too difficult to add this feature. I imagine that such functions would be scoped to the enclosing xsl:mode, and would automatically have higher import precedence than anything outside the mode. There are probably a few complications e.g. if the arity range overlaps a function with the same name declared outside the enclosed mode, but I would think it's manageable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
