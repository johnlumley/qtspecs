   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Casting from duration to string&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We've just been examining the rules for casting from duration / dayTimeDuration / yearMonthDuration to string (F+O section 20.1.1) and they are fairly impenetrable: I think we could do better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We use the phrase "canonical representation as defined in XSD 1.1 part 2"; a more specific reference would be helpful. Mentioning the function &lt;code&gt;·durationCanonicalMap·&lt;/code&gt; would take readers straight to the right place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The actual XSD spec has one or two typos, and uses some notations that might not be immediately obvious to every reader, for example &lt;code&gt;|m|&lt;/code&gt; to mean &lt;code&gt;abs(m)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the best answer to this is to add non-normative examples, which are badly missing from this whole section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would probably require splitting of 20.1.1 into subsections. Alternatively, we could add examples to the string() function, which would have the benefit that we have validation machinery to check that the examples under a specific function are correct; we could point to these examples from 20.1.1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
