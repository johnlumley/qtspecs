   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Declare named record types&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raised in response to action QT4CG-063-06.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently named item types are simply an alias - except when they declare a record type, in which case they have some magic properties by allowing the record type to be recursive, and by the fact that they implicitly create constructor functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would also like to refine these constructor functions for example by allowing default values for fields to be defined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might therefore make sense to define a separate construct for declaring named record types (in both XQuery and XSLT), and perhaps putting these in a separate category in the static context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We might also consider introducing some built-in named record types, for example for key-value pairs, so that users can conveniently construct instances of these record types without explicitly declaring them. These would presumably be in the fn namespace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
