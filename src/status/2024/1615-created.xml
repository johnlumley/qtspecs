   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drop the terms "module context" and "expression context"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not at all clear what these terms are supposed to mean; they are rarely used, and when they are used, they only cause confusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the sentence "The names of public variables and public functions must be unique within the [module contexts] of a query" doesn't bear scrutiny. (Can variables have the same names as functions? Yes they can. Can they have the same names as private variables and functions in the same module? No they can't.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term "expression context" can probably be usefully replaced in most places by "the static context of an expression".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that the idea behind "module context" is that a large part of the static context for expressions is the same for all expressions within a module. But I think that when we use the term, there is usually a better way of saying what we mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
