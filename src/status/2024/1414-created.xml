   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;XSLT spec abstract, introduction&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As currently written, preliminary parts of the the XSLT specs are out of sync with other specs, or have inconsistencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The section called Abstract mostly describes what's different in 4.0. That despite a section shortly later specially devoted to the topic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The section called Abstract does not lead with its best foot forward: the language does a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; more than XML-to-XML transforms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The section called "What is XSLT?" never answers the question posed in the header.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The section called "What is XSLT?" begins with a sentence that both repeats earlier material and is not germane to the header.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the attached PR, I have proposed moving several paragraphs. I have not intentionally edited them. I have also taken a stab at defining XSLT. I have tried to calibrate the Abstract so that it is both sparing, in the spirit of the XQFO abstract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't think that what I've put in here is any way finalized. But I hope it is a step in the right direction, and a good basis for further refinement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
