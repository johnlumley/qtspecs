   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Byte ordering of CRC-32 hash result&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Test case hash-str-034 takes a 150,000-character string consisting of 50,000 repetitions of the string "ABC", and computes its CRC-32 hash value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Java the result comes back as decimal 105475755, which we translate to 0x06496EAB&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On C# the result comes back as a 4-byte array AB 6E 49 06. My guess is we need to reverse the byte order, but I'd like to understand why...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess we need to say something about byte ordering, but what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to find the definitive specification. We simply point to IEEE 802.3 without a specific URI or section or version number. 802.3 actually appears to be a large family of standards. Can we do better than that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm interested to know whether the specification actually defines the result to be a 32-bit (unsigned?) integer rather than an array of four bytes. If that's the case, then our spec needs to say how the 32-bit integer is converted to a sequence of 4 octets, which is what fn:hash actually returns. The C# example shows that there's more than one way of doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
