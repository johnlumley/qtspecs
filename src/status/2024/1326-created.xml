   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Misleading summary for concat() - "string value"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The summary of fn:concat says that it concatenates the string values of its arguments. This isn't strictly correct: if a node is supplied as an argument, the node is atomized and the typed value is cast to a string, which doesn't necessarily give you the same result. For example (a) if the node is an attribute whose type is list, the result is the elements of the list without space separation, and (b) if the node is an element with element-only content, concat() fails although string() would succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 3.1, supplying a list-valued attribute would fail because the required type of each argument was &lt;code&gt;xs:anyAtomicType?&lt;/code&gt;. It now succeeds because the required type is &lt;code&gt;xs:anyAtomicType?&lt;/code&gt; - but perhaps it doesn't have the desired effect?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should clarify these points with notes and examples. Also affects the &lt;code&gt;||&lt;/code&gt; operator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
