   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rendition of record definitions in F&amp;amp;O spec&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We're making progress here but there are still things that need fixing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently a record definition like uri-structure-record is expanded:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(a) into a full definition (with explanations of all the fields) at the point where a PI of the form &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;?record-description uri-structure-record?&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;appears. This may be either within a specific function entry in the function catalog, or in the narrative prose of xpath-functions.xml.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(b) into a concise definition (without explanations of fields) at the point where the type is referenced in a function signature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A hyperlink to the record definition is created (i) where the type name appears in a function signature, and (ii) manually, using the generic link format &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;loc href="#uri-structure-record"&amp;gt;uri-structure-record&amp;lt;/loc&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. However, the target of the link is the first concise definition (see (b) above) rather than the full definition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also some limitations in the rendering of the definitions. The full definition does not indicate which fields are optional/required, though this information is available in the XML. Neither the full nor the concise definition appears to indicate whether the record is extensible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
