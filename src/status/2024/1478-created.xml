   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drop variadic functions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We've made a decision -- for good reasons of maintaining extensibility -- not to make any of the functions in the system function library variadic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this raises the question of whether the feature is worth retaining. And we already had the situation that many functions that were obvious candidates for variadicity (min, max, distinct-values, sum) couldn't use the feature because they already had additional optional arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it's not a good design principle for system-defined functions, then the same applies equally to user-defined functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could drop the feature and just revert to defining concat() as a special case. It would remove a significant amount of complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
