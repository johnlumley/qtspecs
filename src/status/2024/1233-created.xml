   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;517 Major edits to fn:chain, clarification only&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;@dnovatchev For your review. The current version of &lt;code&gt;fn:chain&lt;/code&gt; in the specs has unnecessary verbiage, is out of sync with other comparable spec entries, and has passages that cry out for clarity and concision. I do not think I have made any edits that change any substantive points. A summary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Summary simplified&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rules: prose for the recursive process brought into conformity with other functions in the specs that describe recursive processes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Error conditions: two entries, and clarification of the conditions when they are triggered.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Former note 1 deleted (excessively wordy, introduces unfamiliar or unnecessary terms/concepts).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Former notes 3 and 4 moved to rules, distilled into more concise prose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Former note 5 (now 2) recast to convey what I think was your original intent, and allows the reader to more quickly compare &lt;code&gt;fn:chain&lt;/code&gt; to two comparable methods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Signature, properties, XPath rule, and examples are unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
