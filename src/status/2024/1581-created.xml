   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;69 Add default for current-merge-group $source&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I found that the two functions mentioned in the issue (document and function-available) had been updated as suggested. However I also checked all the XSLT-specific functions, and found that for current-merge-group(), the prose has been updated to say what happens if the argument is omitted, but the signature does not actually define a default. I have corrected this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fix #69&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
