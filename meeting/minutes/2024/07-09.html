MK introduces the issue. The substantive changes are in the grammar appendix.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>MK: Some of the rules need to be clarified as they depend on how you
interpreted some of the rules in 3.1
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>… I’ve tried to describe carefully what a tokenizer should do.</li>
<li>(MK walks through the various cases.)</li>
<li>… A name character after a “&lt;“ is a bit tricky.</li>
<li>… This is done without appeal to the context.</li>
<li>… There’s a note about compatibility and the infamous <code>10 div-3</code> example.</li>
<li>… The longest token rule has previously required you to know the context;
we’ve abandoned that.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>NW: I’ve checked the diff and it looks clean despite the weirdness in the diff
version.</li>
<li>JWL: Is it worth noting that these rules don’t apply to the full-width “&lt;“
character?</li>
<li>MK: Maybe, but we’d be in danger of repeating ourselves.</li>
<li>JLO: Why can’t we enforce a space after the “&lt;“?</li>
<li>MK: Compatibility.</li>
<li>JLO: But isn’t it also incompatible to require the space after <code>div</code>?</li>
<li>MK: You’ve always been able to write <code>price&lt;discount</code> without a space (where
they are both element names).
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>… The other problem would be that it would impose a constraint on XPath
users that only applies to XQuery.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>DN: I think in the past I’ve observed that we have trouble because we have so
many operators. My reaction to this was the chain function which doesn’t
require any operator at all.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>… I think this problem is artificial. It’s artificially raised by the
over-abundance of operators.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
(Some discussion of the fact that the problem is associated with “&lt;“ and not the
abundance of operators.)
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>MSM: I disagree with DN only in one respect, I think the problem was clear 20 years ago!
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>… Every simplifaction is welcome to me. MK says you’ve always been able to
write <code>a&lt;b</code> without spaces in XPath when <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are element names. But
you also said that not everyone parses the same way. Do we have emperical
evidence that everyone does that bit correctly?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>MK: The <code>div-3</code> issue is certainly a very problematic case that we’ve know
about for years. And the spec is notoriously vague on that one. There’s never
been any rule in XPath that you need spaces around a “&lt;“ sign and I think it’s
unlikely that any implementation has imposed that rule. If they do, they’re
pretty clearly wrong.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="pr-1266"><span class="section-number-3">2.2.</span> PR #1266: 1158 Add array mapping operator</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-pr-1266">
<p>
See PR <a href="https://qt4cg.org/dashboard/#pr-1266">#1266</a>
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>MK: This introduces another bit of syntactic magic, but it’s justified by the
fact that the sequence mapping operator has proved very popular. This makes it
possible to do with arrays what you can do with sequences.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>… The <code>!!</code> operator is introduced to map arrays.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>DN: Continuing what I said previously: not only is this difficult to write and
understand, it’s very error prone. Suppose I write “!” when I wanted “!!” or
vice-versa. The possibility of making mistakes makes this unacceptable.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>… Maybe I’d expect “!!!” and “!!!!” in the future!</li>
</ul></li>
<li>MK: Yes, I fully accept that the argument that we’re adding too many rather
cryptic operators. At the same time, on balance I think it’s better to have
this one than not have it.</li>
<li>CG: What I can report from our users is that there are two groups of people:
some like a concise syntax and welcome new operators of that kind. And others
are already lost from other extensions. You can always say “don’t use it if
you don’t like it.” But I think we’ve already agreed to address expert users
with new constructs.</li>
<li>JWL: Just to clarify, if the left hand part was a sequence of arrays, would I
use “!” and then “!!”?</li>
<li>MK: I restricted the left hand side to be an empty sequence or a single array.</li>
<li>JWL: Yes, but you could map over a sequence of arrays with a double mapping.</li>
<li>MK: Yes, and at that point you’re probably better of with FLOWR expressions.</li>
<li>JK: Could this also be applied and leveraged for maps? If we consider an array
just a map with numeric keys, you could apply this to the values of a map.</li>
<li>MK: Worth exploring, but I thought that would be too complicated and not
really needed.</li>
<li>MSM: Thank you, CG, for putting it the way he did. He’s made me think it in a
slightly different way. When I used to teach XPath to beginners, I always told
users not to use the abbreviated syntax until it was boring. I feel much the
same way about FLOWR expressions. That leads me to a concrete suggestion: you
could do this with a FLOWR expression and I think it would be useful if the
introduction of the operator gave an equivalent FLOWR expression.</li>
<li>MK: Yes, you can define how you’d solve the problem with a FLOWR expression,
but you can show an equivalent expression because we don’t have a way to bind
the context value.</li>
<li>MSM: Give an example and maybe point out the crucial difference.</li>
<li>JLO: I learned from a previous comment that if there’s a sequence of arrays
you’d really need to do <code>! . !!</code>?</li>
<li>MK: I think if you had a sequence of arrays, a compound FLOWR expression would
be better.</li>
<li>JLO: We have “/”, “//”, and “?” and “??”, and… In that regard it would make
sense to me if a sequence of arrays would be mapped with “!!”. Would that make sense?</li>
<li>MK: It could be done that way. On the whole we’ve gone against operators that
do implicit mapping over sequences. I’ve tried to keep it simple for the moment.</li>
<li>CG: It’s really difficult to find other operators/characters that are more
intuitive. I wouldn’t have guessed that “!!” had anything to do with arrays.</li>
<li>MK: Yes. Choosing punctuation symbols is always a little arbitrary. Sometimes
they have mnemonic value and sometimes they don’t.</li>
<li>CG: We don’t have any other use of “!” with arrays.</li>
<li>MK: I think the mnemonic is that it’s an extension of the “!” operator.</li>
<li>JWL: I think JLO’s idea has some merit. It would allow the left hand side to be an empty sequence.</li>
<li>MK: That’s already allowed. I decided to handle that case but not multiple arrays.</li>
<li>WP: I’m not sure I have all the context. There’s a two level problem, we want
to solve the problem but at a lower level we have the observations that DN has
made. Documenting it as MSM suggests seems like a good idea. I’d be more
comfortable with DN’s comments if we knew what the boundaries are. I like the
feature, but I see the issues DN is raising.</li>
<li>MK: It’s a classic feature creep problem. It’s always possible to add “one
more feature” and then you discover you’ve added 500.</li>
<li>WP: This is a feature requested by users?</li>
<li>MK: It fulfills an obvious gap.</li>
<li>WP: It’s accounting for completeness. That’s a balancing factor against
simplicity.</li>
<li>MK: There’s an orthogonality argument: if a feature exists for sequences, it
should exist for arrays.</li>
<li>DN: Several things. I think that for many of our creations, we need to
remember “KISS”: keep it simple stupid. The fact that we’re out of special
characters and we need repetitions, should ring a bell to tell us to stop
creating new operators! I think CG said expert user like this notation, but
I’m not sure I’m convinced. I don’t consider myself a novice user, but I don’t
like it. When I write new courses for XPath 4.0, I will definitely tell users
to avoid these operators and especially long chains of them.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>… I can’t over-emphasize my frustration with this issue.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>SF: One argument against the simplicity argument: languages tend to have at
most 128 phonemes. That seems to be a limiting factor of human cogition. The
idea that we should keep the operators simple flies in the face of the
limitations of ASCII. This is a chaining operator and we need to keep the
semantics understandable.</li>
<li>DN: Regarding what SF said, I largely agree. But also, we’re not linguists,
from a historical perspective: what were the operators. Very few gestures were
preserved, most things were replaced by meaningful words.</li>
<li>SF: If we’re concerned about multiple characters. We could use Unicode. I’d be
in favor of a dual approach were we have single Unicode characters and ASCII
representation.</li>
<li>JLO: I like the idea of this mapping, but I’d really like to see it made to
traverse over lists. Extending ! and !! along the lines of / or //. I never
heard anyone say it wouldn’t be possible.</li>
<li>NW: We have one person strongly opposed and when I asked for support, I got a
luke-warm response at best.</li>
</ul>

<p>
NW: I don’t believe we have consensus to add this.

Are we ready for this? Let’s give it a try…
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>MK: We’ve reviewed this before and gone back and forth a bit.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>… We had an example in our own spec where we used position arguments.</li>
<li>… We left fold-left and fold-right the same, what’s changed is the way it’s
described.</li>
<li>… The arity-2 call back is fairly straightforward</li>
<li>… The description of the arity-3 call back is much simpler.</li>
<li>… We do roughly the same thing for fold-left and fold-right</li>
</ul></li>
<li>MK: The description of scan-left and scan-right uses the same mechanism. That
improves the exposition.</li>
<li>DN: I see here at least two problems. Folds as they were originally defined
never had any positional arguments for the action function. This is because
aggregation as a whole doesn’t depend on position. None of the common uses for
folds have any use for position. I did a lot of research and only found one
use of a positional argument in a JavaScript implementation and it was a
contrived example.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>… Now we have another contrived example in our own specification.</li>
<li>… Using the rule that allows a function to be passed with too many arguments
totally destroys type safety.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>DN: A position argument shouldn’t be used and the rule that you can pass extra
arguments destroys type safety. I don’t believe this use of a position will
ever be used more times than I have fingers!</li>
<li>DN: We should reconsider positional arguments and this rule about passing
additional arguments that are ignored.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>… The proposed solution is to specify a new function if you want a
positional argument!</li>
</ul></li>
<li>DN: Initially the specification was executable, but now it’s replaced by code
that isn’t executable. We have examples in our specification of code with errors.</li>
<li>JWL: I noticed the for-each function; is there an argument for symmetry there.</li>
<li>MK: I think it already has one! That’s part of the motivation for this.</li>
<li>CG: I can report that users are already thankful that we added position to
for-each. I think it’s a good idea because so many people know it from
JavaScript. It’s always interesting to know what position your at in a
sequence. It’s pointless to say that for folds positions don’t make sense.</li>
<li>JLO: Since it was questioned why one would need a positional argument in a
fold, I’d like to see windowed flower statmenets expressed in a functional way
and I think this is part of the way.</li>
<li>MK: I think some persuasive use cases would help.</li>
<li>DN: I wanted to remind everyone that blinding following uniformity is bad.</li>
</ul>

We’ve run out of time and this has been a somewhat contentious issue. Let’s try
to carry on the discussion in email and come back to this next week.
