critical mass and no objection to continuing.

* Technical agenda
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: technical-agenda
:END:

The goal with respect to PRs this week is to close as many as we can. To that
end, I’ve tried to arrange them such that the “easy” ones are at the top. If we
discover that one of them isn’t easy, we’ll can move it to the bottom of the
list move on until we’ve done all the easy ones we have time for.

** Where are we?
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: where-are-we
:END:

We’ve been meeting regularly for two years as of this month.

What have we accomplished and what is left to do?

One measure of this question is the list of open “required-for-4.0” issues. But
perhaps we should take a broader perspective.
