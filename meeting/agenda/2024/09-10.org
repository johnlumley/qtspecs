** Issue #755: Expression for binding the Context Value
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: issue-755
:END:
See issue [[https://github.com/qt4cg/qtspecs/issues/755][#755]].

There has been a lot of discussion in this issue and a lot of controversy.
Please review the issue and be prepared to engage in productive discussion.

Remember that we are designing a language for several different constituencies:
new users, casual users, experienced users, and expert users, at least. We all
start as new users and rise to some level of experience with each language and
to some extent each language feature.

It’s reasonable to argue that a feature has implications with respect to new
users. But it’s equally reasonable to argue that a feature (or the lack of a
feature) has implications for expert users.
