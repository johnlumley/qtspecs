+ Reminder, who will be there?
+ What do we want to accomplish?
+ Scheduling?
  + We know some folks won’t be able to attend, I propose that we schedule an
    hour Zoom call at the end of the day for anyone not present who wants to
    discuss what we’ve decided. Perhaps scheduled at the usual time of
    17:00CEST (16:00BST, 15:00GMT, 11:00EDT)?
    + If so, do we want to meet from 09:00-18:00 or 10:00-18:00 local time?


* Technical Agenda
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: technical-agenda
:END:

It would be nice to pick off the low-hanging fruit first in preparation for the
face-to-face. I suggest we take the issues in turn, but begin by estimating if
we believe we can close the issue in 10 minutes. If not, move on to the next.
After we’ve processed all the “easy” ones, we can loop back around to what’s
left.
