* Technical Agenda

** Community, communication, and consensus
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: communication
:END:

Can we make our process less…fractious?

When a working group cannot discuss issues in an open, candid manner with mutal
respect and understanding, it begins to break down. Let’s take a few minutes to
reassure each other that we’re all on the same side here.

Some proposals succeed, some fail. Some issues are taken up in earnest, some
languish. Sometimes the merits of our arguments are immediately recognized,
sometimes they fall on deaf ears. Sometimes unanimity can be achieved, sometimes
it cannot.

When unanimity cannot be achieved, we attempt to operate on the basis of “rough
consensus”. If there’s a clear majority opinion, we choose to adopt that as the
status quo. That doesn’t mean an issue cannot be revisited, that new information
cannot arise which persuades us to change our minds, but it offers us a way to
make incremental progress towards our goal.

If you find yourself in the majority, remember that the minority are smart and
capable and arguing in good faith. That they have not been persuaded should be
cause for sincere reflection. If you find yourself in the minority, remember
that the majority are smart and capable and arguing in good faith. If your
technical arguments were unpersuasive, repeating them more stridently with more
dramatic metaphors isn’t likely to be persuasive either. Sometimes working
groups make decisions that some individuals think are A Very Bad Idea™. There
comes a point at which the most productive thing the minority can do is accept the
decision with the understanding that the objections have been heard and recorded.
