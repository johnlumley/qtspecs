<p>In 4.0 we have taken this rather literally, and have spelled out the consequences in a note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The version numbers 4.01 and 4.1 are equivalent: both have a major number of 4 and a minor number of 1. Version 4.10 by the same reasoning has a higher minor number than version 4.2.</p>

<p>This is completely counter-intuitive.</p>
<p>I propose that we eliminate the confusion by requiring the version number to consist of two single-digit integers separated by a dot.</p>

But we say that some collations only support equality comparison, not ordering. Presumably (we don't actually say), <code>compare(A, B, Collation)</code> will fail if the collation does not support ordering; but if it fails, then equality comparisons will fail as well.</p>
<p>It's not obvious what we should do about this. The simplest fix is probably to say that all collations must support ordering as well as equality comparison. Or we could have a fourth result value from <code>compare()</code> to say "values not equal, but their ordering is not defined"</p>

<p>This enables XSLT keys to be exploited in new ways: for example it becomes easy to merge the indexes for multiple documents, or to iterate over all the keys in a document.</p>
<p>These benefits can already be obtained by scrapping keys entirely and building maps instead; but keys do have some benefits (like remaining implicitly associated with particular documents, and being "more declarative") and if you've got a legacy application that makes extensive use of keys, this function gives you a bridging capability.</p>
<p>There are a few edge cases that will need ironing out, for example keys allow matching using a collation, which maps don't. (And the spec of xsl:key, now I come to think of it, says nothing about comparing date/time values in different timezones; I don't expect anyone has ever tried.)</p>

Maps resulting from JSON convertsions often contain doubles without users noticing it (related: #1583).</p>
<p>We should make the behavior implementation-dependent or align it with the serialization of JSON data (without losing its additional features to e.g. serialize function items or sequences). Backward compliance shouldn’t be an important issue, as the method was mainly introduced for debugging purposes.</p>

Fix #1506
Fix #1485</p>
<p>This PR drops the general concept of declaring named item types in XQuery and XSLT, and focuses on declaring named record types. The rules for named record types are tidied up editorially in XQuery (for example there is a clearer distinction between the syntax production <code>RecordType</code> and the concept of a record type, which can be declared either using that syntax, or otherwise). In XSLT the <code>&lt;xsl:item-type&gt;</code> declaration is dropped and an <code>&lt;xsl:record-type&gt;</code> declaration is introduced.</p>

<p>@michaelhkay suggested that it would be nice to be able to use <code>&lt;function&gt;</code> consistently. This PR attempts to implement that. (It also implements <code>&lt;xfunction&gt;</code> which appears to have been an attempt to do this in the XSLT spec.)</p>
<p>Markup of the form <code>&lt;function&gt;prefix:name#arity&lt;/function&gt;</code> will attempt to find the definition of <code>prefix:name</code> in the F&amp;O and XSLT specifications. It will make an appropriate link. If no <code>prefix</code> is provided <code>fn:</code> is assumed and the <em>#arity</em> part is optional.</p>
<p>If someone can pull this PR locally (instructions below) and kick the tires (excuse me, "tyres") I'd appreciate it. I've done a little spot checking, but I can't say I've been comprehensive.</p>
<p>If we agree to merge this, it will then be possible to cleanup markup in some places. For example, it appears that the F&amp;O spec relies on special processing of <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> rather than <code>&lt;function&gt;</code>. We should never have done that!</p>

<p>For example, the sentence "The names of public variables and public functions must be unique within the [module contexts] of a query" doesn't bear scrutiny. (Can variables have the same names as functions? Yes they can. Can they have the same names as private variables and functions in the same module? No they can't.)</p>
<p>The term "expression context" can probably be usefully replaced in most places by "the static context of an expression".</p>
<p>I think that the idea behind "module context" is that a large part of the static context for expressions is the same for all expressions within a module. But I think that when we use the term, there is usually a better way of saying what we mean.</p>
