Then we realised that records required extra capability, especially recursive definitions and constructors, so we introduced <code>declare record</code> for that case. This begs the question as to whether the general <code>declare type</code> is still useful enough to merit inclusion. I suspect that if we had <code>declare record</code> and didn't have <code>declare type</code>, no one would be clamouring for it.</p>
<p>It's not as if all our work on this feature is done. There's still a fair bit to do on the XSLT side, as well as issues like #1520, and I don't think we've really sorted all the issues relating visibility of types to visibility of variables and functions using those types.</p>

<p>The rationale is that <code>document-node()</code> is often used in situations where a well-formed document is required, and people are more likely to use the more precise type <code>document-node(*)</code> if it can be expressed with less verbosity.</p>
<p>For example, the return type of <code>parse-xml()</code> can then be <code>document-node(*)</code>, and the return type of <code>parse-html()</code> can be <code>document-node(*:xhtml)</code>. I propose also that <code>csv-to-xml()</code> be brought into line by returning <code>document-node(fn:csv)</code>.</p>
<p>There are a number of places in F&amp;O where we currently accept or return <code>document-node()</code> and could be more specific by changing this to <code>document-node(*)</code>.</p>
<p>The verbosity is especially apparent when we want to use the type <code>(document-node(element(X)) | element (X))</code> which can now be abbreviated to <code>(document-node(X) | element(X))</code> which reads much more clearly,</p>
<p>There are also a number of places where we currently require <code>element(*)</code> -- for example the first argument of <code>elements-to-maps</code> -- where it would be user-friendly to change this to <code>(document-node(*) | element(*))</code> (with the semantics that supplying a document node has the same effect as supplying the outermost element of the document).</p>
<p>We should also clarify that <code>document-node(element())</code> does not match a document node having text node children - something that is not currently stated very explicitly.</p>
