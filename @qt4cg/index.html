An additional ambiguity occurs in one of the deep lookup examples:</p>
<pre><code>$tree ??$from ??type(record(to, distance))[?to=$to] ?distance
</code></pre>
<p>which can be simplified to</p>
<pre><code>$tree ??type(foo)
</code></pre>
<p>where there is ambiguity between a <code>LookupExpr</code> with <code>TypeQualifier</code> and a <code>DynamicFunctionCall</code> on a function named <code>type</code>. That is, <code>type</code> should perhaps be one of the restrictions on function name to avoid this ambiguity.</p>
<p>Whether something more fundamental is needed on the productions around [74],[75] and [84]-[88] I'm not sure, but certainly <code>type</code> can appear either as a keyword for <code>TypeQualifier</code> (consuming the bracketed type) or a value of an <code>NCName</code> (with the bracketed section being a higher-level <code>PositionalArgumentList</code>), both being part of a<code> KeySpecifier</code>.</p>

But I think there is one thing missing: they claim that the rules allow you to identify boundaries between tokens unambiguously independently of the syntactic context, but in the case of a token starting with <code>&lt;</code>, this isn't true: to distinguish whether <code>&lt;</code> represents a less-than-operator (or <code>&lt;=</code> operator) or whether it is the start of an element constructor, you need some context information.</p>
<p>Saxon's tokenization is still based on the principles outlined in the XPath 1.0 spec where tokens are disambiguated based on the immediately preceding and following tokens; this is becoming increasingly unviable. Most cases can be handled instead by moving the disambiguation into the parser rather than the tokenizer, but this relies on being able to find token boundaries without knowledge of context (as described in the 4.0 spec), which appears to be possible in all cases except <code>&lt;</code>.</p>
<p>Essentially we need to add an exception to the rule: <em>"If the current position is not the end of the input, then return the longest [literal terminal]( or [variable terminal] that can be matched starting at the current position..."</em></p>
<p>I think the exception might be formulated as follows:</p>
<p><em>In XQuery, when the next character is <code>&lt;</code> and this is immediately followed by an NCNameStart character (for example <code>X</code>) the next token could be either a less than operator, or a DirElemConstructor. The "longest terminal" rule cannot reliably distinguish these cases. Instead, the decision must take into account the syntactic context. A DirElemConstructor can only appear where the parser is expecting to read an expression, while the less-than operator can never appear where the parser is expecting an expression. This aspect of the syntactic context therefore needs to be communicated from the parser to the tokenizer.</em></p>
<p>Alternatively, the two cases might be distinguished by backtracking. The tokenizer could attempt to interpret the text following the <code>&lt;</code> character as a DirElemConstructor, and revert to the alternative interpretation if this fails.</p>
<p>Note: this was not explained clearly in 3.1. Perhaps it was covered by the quixotic phrase "the longest token consistent with the EBNF".</p>

<p>At present the only XPath 4 function (that I am aware of) that can process multiple strings and use multiple collations (a specific collation for a specific string comparison) is <a href="https://qt4cg.org/specifications/xpath-functions-40/Overview.html#func-sort"><strong><code>fn:sort</code></strong></a>.</p>
<p>Some very important functions, such as <a href="https://qt4cg.org/specifications/xpath-functions-40/Overview.html#func-deep-equal"><strong><code>fn:deep-equal</code></strong></a> and <a href="https://qt4cg.org/specifications/xpath-functions-40/Overview.html#func-compare"><strong><code>fn:compare</code></strong></a> can have only one collation as a parameter.</p>
<p>This means that when we are comparing sequences of items which contain multiple strings each of which could need to be handled in a specific collation, we are not able to provide all such collations (but are providing just a single collation) to the comparing function - <code>fn:deep-equal</code> or <code>fn:compare</code>.</p>
<p>The end result is that all string comparisons will be done using that single collation and may not produce the correct result (that would be produced if the particular comparison was done with the particular collation).</p>
<p><strong>Possible solutions</strong>.</p>
<p>It is difficult to provide a solution to this problem and the list below is open ended:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Add a <strong><code>collation</code></strong> property to the type <code>xs:string</code>.
Then we would specify the type as <strong><code>(xs:string, collation-name?)</code></strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make <code>fn:deep-equal</code> and <code>fn:compare</code> accept not a single collation but a sequence of collation-names.
In this case a pair of strings will be compared once for every collation that is specified. The idea is that the sequence of collations would be provided ordered by decreasing specificity. The first result that is produced at least twice in this process (something like voting) would be the result of the comparison. In case of a tie, the comparison done with the collation that is earliest (supposed to be more specific) will have higher priority.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leave this as it is at present, but add to the specification a warning to the user that specifying a single collation-name may not be what they want.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remove from <code>fn:sort</code> the multiple-collations parameter and allow only a single collation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
